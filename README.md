# public-salaries

Analysis of California public employee salaries data. Data was obtained from [Transparent California](https://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/all/) and the [US Census](https://data.ftb.ca.gov/PIT-Charts/California-Median-Income-by-County/6gsn-ex6f/data).

I explored two trends in the data:
- public salaries vs. private salaries
- relationship between salary and population density

### Public salaries vs. private salaries

The majority of California's public employee salaries exceeds the household median income in the respective county. In the plot below, the relative salary is the ratio of salary to the local median income of each county.

### Salary and population density

The median salary increases with population density, with a log-like relationship. The median salary plateaus at around $100k.
